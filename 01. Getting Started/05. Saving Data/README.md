### Saving Data
This class introduces you to the principal data storage options in Android, including:
- Saving key-value pairs of simple data types in a shared preferences file
- Saving arbitrary files in Android's file system
- Using databases managed by SQLite

-----------------------------------------------------------

#### Saving Kay Value Sets
This class shows you how to use the SharedPreferences APIs to store and retrieve simple values.

> **Note:** The `SharedPreferences` APIs are only for reading and writing key-value pairs and you should not confuse them with the `Preference` APIs, which help you build a user interface for your app settings (although they use `SharedPreferences` as their implementation to save the app settings). For information about using the `Preference` APIs, see the [Settings](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/settings.html) guide.
