### Interacting with Other Apps
This class shows you how to use an Intent to perform some basic interactions with other apps, such as:

- start another app.
- receive a result from that app.
- make your app able to respond to intents from other apps.

> An Intent can be explicit in order to start a specific component (a specific Activity instance) or implicit in order to start any component that can handle the intended action (such as "capture a photo").
