### Working with System Permissions
This class shows you how to declare and request permissions for your app.

To protect the system's integrity and the user's privacy, **_Android runs each app in a limited access sandbox_**.

If the app wants to use resources or information outside of its sandbox, the app has to explicitly request permission.
Depending on the type of permission the app requests, the system may grant the permission automatically, or the system may ask the user to grant the permission.
