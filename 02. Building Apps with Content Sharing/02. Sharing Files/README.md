### Sharing Files
Apps often have a need to offer one or more of their files to another app.

This class explains how to securely share files from your app to another app using content URIs generated by the Android [FileProvider](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/content/FileProvider.html) component and temporary permissions that you grant to the receiving app for the content URI.

> Note: The [FileProvider](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/content/FileProvider.html) class is part of the [v4 Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/features.html#v4). For information about including this library in your application, see [Support Library Setup](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/setup.html).
