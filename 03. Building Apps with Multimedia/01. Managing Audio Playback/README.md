### Managing Audio Playback
If your app plays audio, it’s important that your users can control the audio in a predictable manner. 
To ensure a great user experience, it’s also important that your app manages the audio focus to ensure multiple apps aren’t playing audio at the same time. 

Dependencies and prerequisites
- Android 2.0 (API level 5) or higher
- Experience with [Media Playback](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediaplayer.html)
