### Capturing Photos
Using the on-board cameras, your application can enable users to augment what they see around them, make unique avatars, look for zombies around the corner, or simply share their experiences.

This class gets you clicking fast with some super-easy ways of leveraging existing camera applications. 

Dependencies and prerequisites
- Android 2.2 (API level 8) or higher
- A device with a camera

#### Taking Photos Simply
- Leverage other applications and capture photos with just a few lines of code.

This lesson explains how to capture photos using an existing camera application.

_(Suppose you are implementing a crowd-sourced weather service that makes a global weather map by blending together pictures of the sky taken by devices running your client app. Integrating photos is only a small part of your application. You want to take photos with minimal fuss, not reinvent the camera. Happily, most Android-powered devices already have at least one camera application installed. In this lesson, you learn how to make it take a picture for you.)_

#### Recording Videos Simply
- Leverage other applications and record videos with just a few lines of code.

This lesson explains how to capture video using existing camera applications.

_(Your application has a job to do, and integrating videos is only a small part of it. You want to take videos with minimal fuss, and not reinvent the camcorder.)_

#### Controlling the Camera
- Control the camera hardware directly and implement your own camera application.

This lesson explains how to control the camera hardware directly using the framework APIs.

If you want to build a specialized camera application or something fully integrated in your app UI, this lesson shows you how.
