#### Taking Photos Simply
- Leverage other applications and capture photos with just a few lines of code.

This lesson explains how to capture photos using an existing camera application.

_(Suppose you are implementing a crowd-sourced weather service that makes a global weather map by blending together pictures of the sky taken by devices running your client app. Integrating photos is only a small part of your application. You want to take photos with minimal fuss, not reinvent the camera. Happily, most Android-powered devices already have at least one camera application installed. In this lesson, you learn how to make it take a picture for you.)_
