### Printing Content
Being able to print information from your Android application gives users a way to see a larger version of the content from your app 
or share it with another person who is not using your application.

Printing also allows them to create a snapshot of information that does not depend on having a device, sufficient battery power, or a wireless network connection.

Dependencies and prerequisites
- Android 4.4 (API Level 19) or higher

Taking and sharing photos is one of the most popular uses for mobile devices.
If your application takes photos, displays them, or allows users to share images, you should consider enabling printing of those images in your application.
The [Android Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index.html) provides a convenient function for enabling image printing using a minimal amount of code and simple set of print layout options.
