### Printing Content
Being able to print information from your Android application gives users a way to see a larger version of the content from your app 
or share it with another person who is not using your application.

Printing also allows them to create a snapshot of information that does not depend on having a device, sufficient battery power, or a wireless network connection.

Dependencies and prerequisites
- Android 4.4 (API Level 19) or higher
