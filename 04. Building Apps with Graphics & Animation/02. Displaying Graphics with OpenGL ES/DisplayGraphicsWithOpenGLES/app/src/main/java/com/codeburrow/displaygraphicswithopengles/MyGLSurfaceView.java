/**
 * A GLSurfaceView is a specialized view where you can draw OpenGL ES graphics.
 * It does not do much by itself.
 * The actual drawing of objects is controlled in the GLSurfaceView.Renderer
 * that you set on this view.
 * In fact, the code for this object is so thin, you may be tempted to skip extending it
 * and just create an unmodified GLSurfaceView instance, but donâ€™t do that.
 * You need to extend this class in order to capture touch events,
 * which is covered in the Responding to Touch Events lesson.
 * <p/>
 * The essential code for a GLSurfaceView is minimal, so for a quick implementation,
 * it is common to just create an inner class in the activity that uses it
