### Animating Views Using Scenes and Transitions
Learn how to animate state changes in a view hierarchy using transitions.

This class teaches you to use the built-in animations in the transitions framework to animate changes between view hierarchies. This class also covers how to create custom animations.

Android includes the transitions framework, which enables you to easily animate changes between two view hierarchies. The framework animates the views at runtime by changing some of their property values over time. The framework includes built-in animations for common effects and lets you create custom animations and transition lifecycle callbacks.

> **Note:** For Android versions earlier than 4.4.2 (API level 19) but greater than or equal to Android 4.0 (API level 14), use the `animateLayoutChanges` attribute to animate layouts. To learn more, see [Property Animation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/prop-animation.html) and [Animating Layout Changes](https://developer.android.com/training/animation/layout.html).
