### Add Animations
Learn how to add transitional animations to your user interface.

This training class shows you how to implement some common types of animations that can increase usability and add flair without annoying your users.

Animations can add subtle visual cues that notify users about what's going on in your app and improve their mental model of your app's interface. 
Animations are especially useful when the screen changes state, such as when content loads or new actions become available.
Animations can also add a polished look to your app, which gives your app a higher quality feel.

_Keep in mind though, that overusing animations or using them at the wrong time can be detrimental, such as when they cause delays._
