### Connecting Devices Wirelessly
Learn how to find and connect to local devices using Network Service Discovery and how to create peer-to-peer connections with Wi-Fi.

This class describes the key APIs for finding and connecting to other devices from your application. Specifically, it describes the **NSD API** for discovering available services and the **Wi-Fi Peer-to-Peer (P2P) API** for doing peer-to-peer wireless connections. 

This class also shows you how to use NSD and Wi-Fi P2P in combination to detect the services offered by a device and connect to the device when neither device is connected to a network.

Besides enabling communication with the cloud, Android's wireless APIs also enable communication with other devices on the same local network, and even devices which are not on a network, but are physically nearby. The addition of Network Service Discovery (NSD) takes this further by allowing an application to seek out a nearby device running services with which it can communicate. Integrating this functionality into your application helps you provide a wide range of features, such as playing games with users in the same room, pulling images from a networked NSD-enabled webcam, or remotely logging into other machines on the same network.
